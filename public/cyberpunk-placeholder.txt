This is where you would place a cyberpunk-style video background:
- cyberpunk-city.mp4
- matrix-rain.mp4
- digital-circuit.mp4

The video should be:
- Short duration (10-30 seconds) and looped
- Low opacity (around 30%) so it doesn't interfere with the game
- Optimized for web (compressed)
- Resolution around 1920x1080 or lower

For now, the background will work without the video and show the animated grid and particles instead.
