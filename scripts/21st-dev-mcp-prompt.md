# Criminal Lineup Challenge - Game Interface Design Brief

## Project Overview
You are tasked with designing the user interface for "Criminal Lineup Challenge" - an engaging web-based matching game where players test their detective skills by correctly pairing mugshot photos with their corresponding crime descriptions.

## Game Concept & Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- **Objective**: Match 6 criminal mugshots with their actual crimes
- **Format**: Players see 6 mugshot photos and 6 crime descriptions presented separately
- **Interaction**: Click a mugshot, then click a crime description to create a match
- **Scoring**: Points awarded for correct matches, with bonuses for speed and accuracy
- **Challenge**: Crimes are shuffled independently from mugshots, requiring deduction

### Game Flow
1. **Loading**: Game fetches 6 unique criminals from a database of 5,900+ real mugshots
2. **Setup**: Mugshots and crimes are shuffled separately to prevent positional matching
3. **Matching Phase**: Player creates 6 matches (all must be completed)
4. **Submission**: Player submits when all 6 matches are made
5. **Results**: Detailed feedback showing correct/incorrect matches with explanations
6. **Restart**: Option to play again with new set of criminals

## Current Visual Design

### Theme & Aesthetics
- **Dark theme** with gray-900 backgrounds and subtle borders
- **Modern, sleek interface** with card-based layouts
- **Sophisticated color palette**: Blue accents, green for success, red for errors
- **Professional appearance** suitable for crime/justice content

### Existing Components

#### Mugshot Cards (Top Section)
- 2x3 grid layout (responsive: 3 columns on desktop, 2 on mobile)
- Square aspect ratio with criminal photos
- Name labels at bottom of each photo
- Selection states: Normal, Selected (blue border), Matched (green border)
- Hover effects and subtle animations

#### Crime Description Cards (Bottom Section)
- 1-3 column responsive grid
- Compact card design (recently optimized for mobile)
- Crime text with optional sentencing information
- Status indicators: Unmatched, Matched (shows criminal's face), Selected
- Profile images replace warning icons when matched

#### Game Stats (Top Bar)
- Timer showing elapsed time
- Match progress (X/6 Correct)
- Accuracy percentage
- Progress bar visualization
- Dark-themed badges with colored accents

#### Results Section
- Comprehensive score breakdown
- Detailed individual results for each match
- Shows user's guess vs actual crime for incorrect answers

## Technical Context

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript

- **Adaptive grid layouts** that stack appropriately
- **Optimized for both phones and desktop**

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy loading** for images
- **Efficient re-renders** during gameplay
- **Minimal data fetching** (6 records per game)
- **Smooth animations** that don't impact performance

## User Experience Goals

## Design Challenges to Solve

### Space Efficiency
- **Mobile optimization** - 12 total cards must fit reasonably on phone screens

- **Visual hierarchy** - Clear distinction between different game sections

### User Feedback
- **Match visualization** - Make connections between photos and crimes obvious
